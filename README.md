# FONS Datathon
Automated checking repository

This is a repository for automated testing of your predictions against the test data.
To make a prediction, submit a pull request with `.csv` files using the names `task_x_prediction.csv` or `bonus_x_prediction.csv` according to the number of task you wish to be scored.
These `.csv` files should be one prediction per line, with a total line length of 3,363 to match the test dataset size.
Once you have submitted your pull request, wait a few minutes and your results will appear in the comments! 
If you are confused how to format your `.csv`, see `example_predictions.csv` or ask a demonstrator!
If you are new to GitHub and haven't submitted a pull request before, please ask a demonstrator!
